## Navigate to the install page

The first step is to [install our Gorgias App](https://ai.textyess.com/integrations/gorgias).

## This will allow us to:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a TextYess view">
    The app will automatically create a view named "TextYess" where all new conversations with the AI agent will be visible
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a new HTTP integration">
    The app will automatically create a new HTTP integration where all new ticket messages created from your Gorgias account will be sent to TextYess. Remember that sending messages from Gorgias's ticket page will stop the AI to reply to the customer!
  </Step>
</Steps>

## On every new WhatsApp conversation:

The customer will be created with a `@textyess.com` email and their phone number attached.\
The app will then **create a new ticket in Gorgias with status: “open”**.

While the AI agent manages the conversation, it will automatically send replies to the customer.\
If at any point the AI determines that the customer needs to contact your support team, the ticket will stay open and can be handled directly by your agents in Gorgias.

If a support team member sends a message to the customer from Gorgias, the AI will stop responding and the conversation will be managed exclusively by the support team.
