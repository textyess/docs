## Navigate to the install page

The first step is to [install our Gorgias App](https://ai.textyess.com/integrations/gorgias).

## This will allow us to:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a TextYess view">
    The app will automatically create a view named "TextYess" where all new conversations with the AI agent will be visible
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a new HTTP integration">
     The app will automatically create a new HTTP integration where all new ticket messages created from your Gorgias account will be sent to TextYess.
     Remember that sending messages from Gorgias's ticket page will stop the AI to reply to the customer!
  </Step>
</Steps>


## On every new WhatsApp conversation:
  
  The customer will be created with a @textyess.com email and attached his phone number.
  The app then will create a ticket with status: **"closed"**, this status means that the AI will continue to generate responses
  until the customer asks to chat with a custom support member, once this happens, the ticket status will be: **"open"**.

  If a customer support member wants to join the conversation and sends a message to the customer, the AI will stop generating responses
  and the conversation will exclusively be handled by the support member.
