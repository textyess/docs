WhatsApp Business Platform offers different types of business accounts to help you connect with your customers.


## Types of Business Accounts

There are two main types of WhatsApp Business Accounts:

### Business Account

- This is the default account type for any business using the WhatsApp Business Platform
- WhatsApp verifies the authenticity of every brand on the platform
- If the account has completed Business Verification, the business name is visible even if users haven't added it to their contacts
- The display name appears in smaller text in the contacts view unless Business Verified

### Official Business Account

- Distinguished by a blue checkmark badge in the profile and chat thread headers
- Represents verified, notable brands
- Requires additional verification steps

## Requirements for Official Business Account

To qualify for an Official Business Account, your business must meet these criteria:

1. **Notability**: Must be a well-known, frequently searched brand or entity
2. **Verification**: Must complete Business Verification

### Understanding Notability Requirements

Notability is a key requirement for obtaining an Official Business Account. Here's what you need to know:

- Your business must be a well-known, frequently searched brand or entity
- Notability is primarily assessed through your presence in online news articles from reputable publications
- The assessment focuses on:
  - Presence in news articles from publications with substantial audiences
  - Coverage in major news outlets (e.g., India Today, Economic Times, Wall Street Journal, Reuters, Wikipedia, Business Insider)
  - Organic media coverage (paid or promotional content is not considered)
  - Business listings and app store presence are not valid sources for notability assessment

<Tip>
  To improve your chances of meeting notability requirements, focus on building
  your brand's presence in reputable news publications and media outlets.

## How to Request an Official Business Account

<Steps>
  <Step title="Complete Business Verification">
    Ensure your business has completed the Business Verification process. This
    is a prerequisite for requesting OBA status.
    <br />
    For detailed instructions on Business Verification, visit the [Meta Business
    Help Center](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/2058515294227817?id=180505742745347).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Submit OBA Request">
    Access WhatsApp Manager from your Business Manager and:
    - Click on the phone number you want to verify
    - Click the "Submit Request" button
    - Provide required information including:
      - Up to 5 supporting links from reputable publications
      - Countries of operation
      - Parent business/brand information
      - Primary language
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for Review">
    WhatsApp will review your request and notify you of the decision. If
    rejected, you can submit a new request after 30 days.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Important Notes About OBA Status

<Warning>
  Official business accounts are issued at the phone number and display name
  level. If you change your display name after receiving OBA status, WhatsApp
  will need to re-assess the new display name for notability and compliance.
</Warning>

<Warning>
  Previous OBA approvals within a WhatsApp Business Account do not guarantee
  approval for other numbers with different display names.
</Warning>

## Handling Denied Requests

If your OBA request is denied:

- The decision means WhatsApp has carefully reviewed your account and determined it's not eligible for OBA status at this time
- These decisions cannot be appealed
- You can submit a new request after 30 days
- While waiting, you can:
  - Continue to grow your business presence
  - Build your brand's presence in news articles
  - Maintain and update your business profile (profile picture, email, website, business description)
  - Continue using WhatsApp Business Platform with your standard Business Account

<Tip>
  If your WABA contains a main parent brand that meets notability requirements, consider updating child brand display names to: '[sub-brand name] by [notable name]'
</Tip>

<Check>
  Remember that having an Official Business Account is not required to use
  TextYess. A standard Business Account is sufficient for most use cases.
