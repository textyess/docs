    Next, switch to Klaviyo and go to Flows, where you can add the webhook either to an existing flow or create a new one. Paste the destination URL you copied from TextYess into the webhook settings in Klaviyo, and then insert the following JSON body:

    ```
    {
      "first_name": "{{ person.first_name }}",
      "phone_number": "{{ person.phone_number }}",
      "country_code": "IT",
      "email": "{{ person.email }}"
    }
    
    ```
