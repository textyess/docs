Open the **Zendesk Integration** page inside TextYess by navigating to https://ai.textyess.com/integrations/zendesk.

### Create the API token

1. In Zendesk, click the **Admin (gear icon)** on the left sidebar.
2. Go to **Apps and Integrations → API → Zendesk API**.
3. Make sure the checkbox for **“Allow API token access”** is enabled.
4. Under **API Tokens**, click **Add API token**.
5. Add a name for the token, for example “TextYess Integration.”
6. Click **Copy** to save your token somewhere safe — Zendesk will only show it once.
7. Go back to **TextYess → Integrations → Zendesk**.
8. Paste your **Zendesk domain**, **admin email**, and **API token**, then click **Setup Zendesk**.

### This will allow us to:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a TextYess view">
    The app will automatically create a view named "TextYess" where all new conversations with the AI agent will be visible
  </Step>
  <Step title="Handle custom support conversations">
    The app then automatically will send all new replies / comments created from your Zendesk account to TextYess. Remember that sending messages from Zendesk's ticket page will stop the AI to reply to the customer!
  </Step>
</Steps>

## On every new WhatsApp conversation:

1. TextYess automatically creates a **customer in Zendesk** with:
   - Email: `zendesk_<phonenumber>@textyess.com`
   - Their phone number attached to their profile
2. A **ticket is created with status: “solved.”**\
   This indicates the AI is actively managing the conversation.
3. If the **customer replies,** Zendesk automatically reopens the ticket as **“open.”**\
   The AI detects the new message and sends a response.
4. After the AI responds, the ticket is automatically updated back to **“solved.”**
5. If a **human agent** sends a message to the customer from Zendesk, the AI immediately stops replying, and the ticket remains **open** for manual handling.
