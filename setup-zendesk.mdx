## Navigate to the configuration page

The first step is to connect your Zendesk account to TextYess.\
Open the **Zendesk Integration** page inside TextYess by clicking [here](https://ai.textyess.com/integrations/zendesk) or navigating to https://ai.textyess.com/integrations/zendesk.

### Create the API token

1. In Zendesk, click the **Admin (gear icon)** on the left sidebar.
2. Go to **Apps and Integrations → API → Zendesk API**.
3. Make sure the checkbox for **“Allow API token access”** is enabled.
4. Under **API Tokens**, click **Add API token**.
5. Add a name for the token, for example “TextYess Integration.”
6. Click **Copy** to save your token somewhere safe — Zendesk will only show it once.
7. Go back to **TextYess → Integrations → Zendesk**.
8. Paste your **Zendesk domain**, **admin email**, and **API token**, then click **Setup Zendesk**.

✅ TextYess will now automatically create:

- The **Webhook** and **Trigger** needed for message sync
- A **TextYess View** inside Zendesk showing all WhatsApp conversations

  </Step>
</Steps>

## This will allow us to:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a TextYess view">
    The app will automatically create a view named "TextYess" where all new conversations with the AI agent will be visible
  </Step>
  <Step title="Handle custom support conversations">
    The app then automatically will send all new replies / comments created from your Zendesk account to TextYess. Remember that sending messages from Zendesk's ticket page will stop the AI to reply to the customer!
  </Step>
</Steps>

## On every new WhatsApp conversation:

The customer will be created with a [_zendesk+\_phonenumber\_@textyess.com_](mailto:zendesk+__phonenumber__@textyess.com) email and attached his phone number. The app then will create a ticket with status: **"closed"**, this status means that the AI will continue to generate responses until the AI replies to the customer the he needs to contact the customer support, once this happens, the ticket status will be: **"open"**.

If a customer support member wants to join the conversation and sends a message to the customer, the AI will stop generating responses and the conversation will exclusively be handled by the support member.
